# C# Generics Cache System
C# coding challenge: demonstration of a cache system using a dictionary, generics, error handling, time-sensitive entries, thread safety, and cleanup of expired items.



## Challenge: Create a generic cache system called SimpleCache<T> that can store any type of items with the following requirements:

It should have methods to:

Add items with a string key

Get items by key

Remove items by key

Clear all items

A method to get all currently cached keys


Items should expire after a specified time duration (passed in the constructor)

The class should prevent duplicate keys

Include proper error handling

Try implementing this class and I'll help you review and improve it. This will test your understanding of:

Generic type constraints

Working with dictionaries

Basic error handling

Time-based operations
